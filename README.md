## Hi I'm Jeevan

I'm a full stack software developer with a strong foundation in coding and problem solving. I've recently completed a 20 week course through Dev Academy Aotearoa with a certificate in applied software development.

I'm eager to apply my problem solving skills and my technical skills to build amazing tech as part of a development team.
